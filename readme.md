# Lancescript Reloaded
chatPlus intelligently replaces the default chat system with a new, sophisticated, configurable one.  
Some features of chatPlus include:  
- Muting player chats  
- Coloring player names conditionally, i.e modder names are colored red  
- Set custom tags, set them to Stand detection tags, or disable them altogether  
- Set max chat lengths  
- Set max visible chats  
- UwU mode  
  
The best part of chatPlus is it uses the exact same GUI/scaleform of the original chat, and sending messages is exactly the same. So there is no learning curve or "getting used to it" whatsoever. Just extra little things and enhancements.   
  
## Install
Download the repo as zip and drag everything from it, except readme.md and license.txt, into your Stand's lua scripts folder. Done.  
Bug reports and suggestions should go into the Discord (there is a button in the script menu to access it).

## Cons  
chatPlus is, unfortunately, not magic.  
The following cons exist for chatPlus and really can't be avoided:  
- There is no history scrolling. What you see is what you get.  
- Because of how the script has to work, every message sent, including muted messages, will play a short animation as if every message in the chatbox was resent. (although a pretty minor issue)  
- Some other strange behavior might be encountered.
